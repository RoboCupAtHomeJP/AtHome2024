# Technical Challenge

The Technical Challenge is conducted based on the
[RoboCup 2022 Rulebook (Revision 2022-06-30 1298)](https://athome.robocup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022_rulebook.pdf), Chapter 7: Finals (pp. 85-86). However, the following items are modified.

## 7.1 Structure and Theme

The objective is set by each team. Japanese and English languages are allowed to be used.

## 7.3 Scoring

The score of the Technical Challenge is not to be reflected in the competition score. The Technical Challenge is scored and awarded individually. Therefore, **7.4 Final Ranking and Winner** are invalid.
