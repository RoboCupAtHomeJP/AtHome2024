# General Purpose Service Robot - GPSR

Reference video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef1RzF9Wj9U

> [!WARNING]
> This is a sample video for reference and the task content may differ depending on the RoboCup@Home JapanOpen rules.


## Description

The robot is asked to understand and execute commands requiring a wide range of different abilities.


## Focus

*Task planning*, *object/people detection and recognition*, *object feature recognition*, *object manipulation*


## Setup

- **Locations**:
  - **Task location**: The task takes place inside the *Arena*, but some commands may require the robot to go out.
  The *Arena* is in its nominal state for this task.
  - **Start Location**: The robot starts from a *predefined location* announced in the *Setup Days*.
  When the `TC` gives the *start signal*, the robot moves towards the *Instruction Location*.
  - **Instruction Location**: At the beginning of the test, as well as after finishing the first and second command, the robot moves to the *Instruction Location*.
  This *Instruction Location* is announced in the *Setup Days*.
- **People**:
  - **Host**: The host instructs the robot commands given by the `TC`.
  The host is selected from the competing team.
  - **Guests**: Guests interact with the robot through gestures and other means depending on the selected task.
  Up to three (3) guests will be inside the *Arena*.


## Procedure

1. **Start Phase**

    1. **Task Time**: The time limit is **ten (10) minutes**.

    1. **Setup**: The TC instructs the team to move the robot to the *Start Location*.

    1. **Category Selection**: The team tells the `TC` the selected category.
    Depending on the category, the `TC` choose an arbitrary command and gives it to the host.
        - **DEM Category**: Instructions with pre-defined sentence structure.
        - **Regular Category**: Instructions generated from [Command Generator](https://github.com/RoboCupAtHomeJP/CommandGenerator/tree/rcj24_for_opl).

    1. **Start**: The TC gives the *start signal* and starts the timer.
    The team completes the setup (pressing the start button, etc.) and leaves the area.
    No complex setup procedures are allowed, such as pressing two or more buttons.

    1. **Goal**: The robot performs the command phase and service phase for three (3) times.

1. **Command Phase**

    1. **Navigation to Host**: The robot navigates to the *Instruction Location*.

    1. **Instruct the Robot**: The host commands the given task to the robot.
    If the robot cannot understand the name or favorite drink, the robot can request the guest to repeat the command and no penalty is given.

1. **Service Phase**

    1. **Command Confirmation**: After receiving the command, the robot confirms it before starting to execute the task.

    1. **Command Execution**: The robot performs the task given in the instructions.


## Additional Rules and Remarks

### Skipping Commands

The robot performs the command phase and service phase for three (3) times.
However, the competing team is able to skip to the next command if the robot misunderstood the given command by the host.
In order to demonstrate so, the robot needs to complete the mistaken task, and go back to the host position requesting for another task.

> [!WARNING]
> Teams may not take advantage of this rule to skip commands until their desired command is given.

### Command Generator

Commands are generated using the [Command Generator](https://github.com/RoboCupAtHomeJP/CommandGenerator/tree/rcj24_for_opl).
The TC generates arbitrarily the commands in advance to confirm the commands are correct according to the environment.

If the team chooses *DEM Category*, while maintaining impartiality, the command given will be prepared in advance and based on the [DEM Category Sentence Structure](). 


## Deus Ex Machina

If the *Deus Ex Machina* listed in the *General Rules* is used during the execution of a task, points are deducted, up to ten (10) times.

For example:
- bypassing speech recognition by using an alternative HRI
- receiving human assistance to accomplish a task
- instructing a human assistant to perform the whole task

Moreover, the teams are allowed to lower the difficulte of the *Regular Category* by choosing *DEM Category*.
However, the given points will be reflected based on its weight, defined on [Weights per Category](#weights-per-category)


## Restart

Restarts are handled as follows, depending on the Phase.
In any case, the robot needs to start from the *Start Location*.
If the robot has completed *Step 1* defined in the [Steps per Category](#steps-per-category) section, the robot can continue the uncompleted task after restarting.
In this case, the robot does not need to repeat *Command Confirmation* from the *Service Phase* as no penalty will be given.
However, the score earned right after the restart is reduced to half as a penalty.

If restart is decided to be done:
- During the understanding of the $n(\le 2)$th command,
  - Resume from the $n$th command.
- During the execution of *Step 1* for the $n$th time
(if not yet arrived at the destination position, the team is not ready to move to the next Step),
  - Resume from the $n$th command.
- After completing *Step 1* for the $n'(\le 3)$th time,
  - Resume from the $n'$th command.

> [!NOTE]
> If the robot is holding an object, the team decides whether to keep it or put it back.
