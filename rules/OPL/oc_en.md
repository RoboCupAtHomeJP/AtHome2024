# Open Challenge

The *Open Challenge* is conducted based on the

## 7.1 Structure and Theme

The objective is set by each team. Japanese and English languages are allowed to be used.

The score of the *Open Challenge* is not to be reflected in the competition score. The *Open Challenge* is scored and awarded individually. Therefore, **7.4 Final Ranking and Winner** are invalid.
