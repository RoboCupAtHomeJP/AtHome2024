# General rules

## Competition Concept

This competition evaluates how well intelligent robots can engage in natural and friendly communication with users and achieve various support behaviors in daily environments. The competition is designed on the basis of the SIGVerse simulator, which enables robots to make embodied and social interactions in virtual reality (VR) environments. 

Main aspects of the competition, including rules and evaluation methods, are outlined here. For detailed information on software configuration and communication protocols used in the competition, please refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RoboCupatHomeSim).

## Fair Play

Fair play and cooperative behavior are expected from all teams during the entire competition. This includes:
- Not trying to cheat (e.g., pretending autonomous behavior exists where there is none).
- Not trying to exploit the rules (e.g., not trying to solve the task but trying to score).

Disregard of these rules will lead to penalties in the form of negative scores and disqualification for a test or even for the entire competition.

## Troubleshooting

All competition tasks require repetition of several sessions. If the n-th session terminated due to a team's bug, the n-th session score will be zero, and the team will be able to restart only from the subsequent n+1-th session. If the trouble is not a team’s bug, the team can restart from the current n-th session. The cause of the trouble will be determined by the technical committee. The team should cooperate with the technical committee to investigate any trouble, such as by submitting ROS log files and source code.

Should trouble arising from software bugs be found, the technical committee will investigate the problem status, and the executive committee will judge how to deal with the trouble.

## Communication for Competition Operation

The executive and technical committees will often make announcements to organize and operate the competition. The official communication tool between the teams and executive/technical committees will be Discord, so the teams should always check Discord for announcements. Communication by e-mail is not encouraged.
