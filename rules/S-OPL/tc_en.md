# Technical Challenge

## Background and Concept
The aim of this competition is to demonstrate and showcase the capabilities of each team's robot system as a life support robot without the restrictions of competition rules. Teams are encouraged to unveil the latest research and development in new approaches and applications for life support robots.  
This competition allows the use of all types of systems and devices, including actual machines, but the main focus is on utilizing simulation environments to realize intelligent service robots.  
At least one robot simulator or VR software must be used, with SIGVerse recommended, but the type of simulator or VR software does not affect the evaluation results. The evaluation of this competition is independent of the other competitions, and the Open Challenge award will be given to the team that excels in the criteria listed in 5.4.

## Time Allowance & Language Used
Including Q&A, each team has 15 minutes to present.  
The demonstration and presentation time total 10 minutes, and the Q&A session is 5 minutes. Also, each team cannot enter the field until the 15-minute timer starts and must return the field to its original state and exit the field within 15 minutes.  
Both the speech and slides must be in either Japanese or English, and Q&A will also be conducted in Japanese or English.

## Judges
Judges are selected by the executive committee and include experts in robotics research as well as those from outside the field.  
Some judges may not be native English speakers.

## Evaluation Criteria
Judges will evaluate the presentation based on the following criteria:

- Creativity/presentation of the story
- Effectiveness of interaction between the person and robot
- Diversity/universality of system integration
- Difficulty/completeness of performance
- Relevance/practicality in daily life

Additional criteria may be added. In such cases, the executive committee will announce the new criteria at least 7 days before the competition date.
